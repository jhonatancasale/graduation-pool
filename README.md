# Graduation-Pool
It's time for the truth, I'm a dropout of Information Systems of USP (ICMC), currently working as Full Stack Web Developer and one of the Statistics course students of the same University.

And basically, the core idea behind this repository is:

1. Something I can later take a look and keep me engaged in the long run.
2. Keep the inital momentum.
3. Serve as study material.
4. Create an useful content that I can use later in my professional life.
5. It'll be part of my resum√©

I'll provide weekly updates in content and the deadline will be sunday night.  So, I hope this time finish the course instead the course finish me, and in the process (the whole journey) I'll create some value content. And this time, I wish finish the course with some kind of "minor" graduation in here, called **_emphasys in computation_**.

So, it's time to run after my destiny, wish you all the best.
