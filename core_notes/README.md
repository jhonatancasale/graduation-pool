# Core Notes
In this section we found the theoretical things, most of them was presented in classes, but I think it's fair to admit that some amount come from the recommended books and random readings on web.

**Note**, I choose to use LaTex because I believe that will be important to me, as kind of mathematician, know this skill, and because it's free and in most cases, produces fancy and beautiful documents.

And finally, I choose the [Tufte-Style Book](http://www.latextemplates.com/template/tufte-style-book) just for personal motivations, and the sidenotes resource is awesome.
